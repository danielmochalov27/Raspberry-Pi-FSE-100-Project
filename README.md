# Raspberry-Pi-FSE-100-Project
FSE 100 Group 810
The code is supposed to work as the button being able to turn everything off and on and then the ultrasonic sensors as you get closed to something it will beep faster and faster like car parking sensors and then the PIR sensor will utilize the second buzzer to beep when it detects motion in front of the person for example people, pets, and moving objects. If the person wants to use this they click on the button once and it will turn everything or on click again to turn everything off.
